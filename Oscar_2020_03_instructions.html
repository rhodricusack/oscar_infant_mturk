  <h1>Task Instructions</h1>
<p>You and your baby will watch three clips from cartoons and live-action movies. Each clip is 3 minutes long. We will record your infant's looking behaviour via your webcam.</p>
<p>We need to see your infant's eyes in the webcam and so please conduct this study during daytime and make sure your infant faces a window/light source. Your child may be seated on your lap or in a baby seat close to the screen. If you keep your child on your lap, please try to keep your own movements to a minimum as not to influence your child's looking behaviour. If your child is seated in a baby seat, please sit somewhere behind your child to ensure that your child has maximum attention for the screen and is not distracted. </p>
<p>During the study, please try to refrain from interacting with your infant whenever possible. We are interested in infants' natural looking behaviour, so we ask you not to point at the screen or direct their gaze to the video in any other way.</p>

	<p>Please ensure that:
<ul>
	<li>Your child’s face is completely visible; particularly, that nothing is obscuring the child’s eyes.</li>

<li>The camera and computer are placed on a stable platform and will not move during the course of the experiment (for example, on a desk)</li>
		
<li>Your own face is not visible in the webcam footage.</li>
		
<li>Your own reactions are kept to a minimum. Please do not interact with your child unless necessary to keep them in shot or to calm them down; if your child is distressed you may of course comfort them.</li>
<li><font color='red'><i>Please do not interact with your child if at all possible. </i> If your child is distressed you may of course comfort them. Do NOT attempt to redirect your child’s attention to the screen.</font></li>
</ul>

		<td class='tablecaptions'>Incorrect: the participant is backlit, meaning their face is in shadow. As in example 1, the camera is centred on the caregiver, not the infant. </td>
