We know that infants have a predilection for specific forms of visual media; cartoons, for example.  We aim to understand why infants are more interested in these visual stimuli than in others. A better understanding of how infants are learning and developing might allow us to help infants get the best start in life.

If you consent to taking part, you and your infant will be shown a series of clips from cartoons and live-action movies. We will create a recording of your infant's looking behaviour at this video via your webcam, which we use to assess the duration for which your child was watching the clip. In the end, we aim to see whether there is a clear preference regarding the type of stimulus (simple cartoon, complex cartoon, or live-action video) between infant participants. Before we start the study, we will ask you to check that your webcam is working. We further ask you to complete this study during daytime and make sure your infant faces a window, to create optimal lighting conditions for the video-recording. Your child may be seated on your lap or in a baby seat close to the screen. If you keep your child on your lap, please try to keep your own movements to a minimum as not to influence your child's looking behaviour. If your child is seated in a baby seat, please sit somewhere behind your child to ensure that your child has maximum attention for the screen and is not distracted. During the study, please try to refrain from interacting with your infant whenever possible. We are interested in infants' natural looking behaviour, so we ask you not to point at the screen or direct their gaze to the video in any other way. If your infant experiences any distress, you are of course allowed to soothe him or her. After this part of the study, you will be asked to complete a short demographic questionnaire. These activities should take no more than 30 minutes to complete.
